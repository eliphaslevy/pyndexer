<h3>Description of the script</h3>
As it is now, public files are only public if you know the address of them.<br/>
<br/>
As a workaround, this script generates an index.html for a folder and all folders within, with the public links for all files inside.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>ChangeLog</h3>
Read it on the script itself, or the <a href="pyndexer.html">pyndexer.html</a> auto-generated beautifully colored file :)<br/>
As of now, it's in the <b>0.7</b> version, released in <b>2010-02-04</b>.

<h3>Install</h3>
Windows (XP, Vista, 7):<br/>
Download <a href="pyndexer.exe?dl">pyndexer.exe</a> if you do not have a python environment.
Maybe you need MSVCR71.dll too, it is there to download if needed.<br/>
There is also a <a href="pyndexer-nocrypto.exe?dl">nocrypto</a> version that is half the size
if you do not want AES encryption support.<br/>
<br/>
Linux, OSX:<br/>
Download the <a href="pyndexer.py?dl">pyndexer.py</a> script and set its permission to execute
(chmod +x pyndexer.py or use your "explorer" thing).<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre>
pyndexer [args] [Folder1] [...] [FolderN]
  Starts index creation on [Folder1] and others.
  If no folder name given, defaults to Current Working Directory (CWD)
Optional arguments:
  -h --help          This help text
  -v --verbose       Print indexed folders and files to be linked
  -i --ignore        Ignore this file pattern (python's regex re.match)
  -R --recursive     Index subfolders (default)
  -N --nonrecursive  Index the specified folders only
</pre>
<br/>
It is a terminal (console, text-only, white-on-black scary!) program!<br/>
Run it from your favorite terminal (shell) program and pass to it the name of the
folder you want to index as the first argument.  If no arguments are passed, it will
index the Current Working Directory ($CWD) - the place from where you ran it.<br/>
You can drag and drop a folder to the script to automatically "pass" it as the
argument.<br/>
<br/>
If in windows (using the EXE version), you can make a place a shortcut to it on the
special folder "Send To" (open explorer and go to "shell:sendto" to open it) so you
can right-click some public folder, go to the Send To context menu and select pyndexer,
and it will index it.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Encryption</h3>
pyndexer now supports AES-256-CBC encryption of the file listing, if you want to keep
the files somewhat hidden.
The EXE version includes the AES support, but if you use the script version, you will
need <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto">M2Crypto</a> installed.
Use apt-get or something else to install it, like:<br/>
<pre>
apt-get install python-m2crypto <i>(ubuntu)</i>
easy_install m2crypto <i>(python's setuptools)</i>
</pre>
Just put a file named "encrypt.txt" on some folder and it will prompt you to
provide a password for this folder's listing when indexing.<br/>
It will <b>NOT</b> encrypt the files, just the links that point to them, so bewarned.
Thanks to Vincent Cheung's <a href="http://www.vincentcheung.ca/jsencryption/">jsencript</a>
the user's browser will decrypt it on-the-fly.<br/>

<h3>WARNING: DEFAULTS TO WORK RECURSIVELY.</h3>
Meaning it WILL overwrite ALL index.html files in the pointed folder and subfolders!<br/>
Side note: You can always use the revisions feature of dropbox to revert a lost index.html.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Bonus</h3>
If you want to be able to listen to some MP3 on your public folder, go to the "playertest"
subfolder and get the player.swf and swfobject.js files and put on the folder where the music files are.<br/>
It will NOT make a whole MP3 library playable for you, it was <strong>deliberately</strong>
done this way to be difficult to share your entire music with the world. Remember,
<b>dropbox is NOT a content distribution system</b>!<br/>
