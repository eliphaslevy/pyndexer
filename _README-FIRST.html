<h3>pyndexer - index your public folders (semi) automatically!</h3>

Dropbox Forum's discussion thread:
<a href="http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=3075">http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=3075</a><br/>
<br/>
This README is for the <b>1.0 version, NOT READY YET</b>, waiting for some brave forum guys to test and input,
as of <b>2010-06-28</b>. Please stay tuned :)<br/>
It is a given that this file and the script itself will change, so do not republish it, instead
give feedback on the forum thread listed above.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Description of the script</h3>
As it is now, (<i>even after the new sharing model</i>), the files on your Public folder are only public if you know the address to get them, or you want to customize it further - ignore some files, or subfolders, or even password protect some of them.<br/>
<br/>
As a workaround, this script generates an HTML index for a folder and all folders within, with links for files inside each folder.<br/>
Optionally it encrypts the listing so only one with the password can see what is listed.<br/>
As a bonus it will embed the <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player">JW Player</a> to play some mp3 or mp4 files, and more if you want to tweak it.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>ChangeLog</h3>
Read it on the script itself, or the <a href="pyndexer.html">pyndexer.html</a> auto-generated beautifully colored file :)<br/>

<h3>License</h3>
Copyleft. Feel free to copy, edit, and share your thoughts and patches ;)<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Install</h3>
See the <a href="index.html">index</a> to locate what you need to download.<br/>
<br/>
Windows (XP, Vista, 7):<br/>
Download the EXE  if you do not have a
python environment setup.<br/>
Maybe you need MSVCR71.dll too, it is in the pyndexer root folder to download if needed.<br/>
<br/>
Linux, OSX:<br/>
Download the PY script and set its permission to execute
(chmod +x pyndexer.py or use your "explorer" thing).<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Usage</h3>
Download (if needed set it to execute!) and double click.<br/>
It will download the <a href="pyndexer.template.html">template</a> HTML file, and then the sample
<a href="pyndexer.empty.ini">pyndexer.ini</a> INI file (this is what I use to generate
these indexes here) to the same folder as the script itself and will probably rant about
no configured folders found. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Edit the pyndexer.ini as per the examples in the INI.<br/>
<br/>
Caveat: if you have unicode or accented (anything like "ümlauth" or "cachaça") named folders/files to
be indexed, and you want to configure them on the INI, you have to edit the INI with an unicode-aware
text editor (like <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">notepad++</a> - a nice editor!).<br/>
As my tests indicate if you just have non-configured subfolders it will index them fine.<br/>
<br/>
<b>It is a terminal (console, text-only, white-on-black-scary!) program!</b><br/>
Run it from your favorite terminal (shell) and pass to it the name of the
folder/folders you want to index as arguments. It accepts no other things.
If no arguments are passed, it will index the "Current Configured Folders"
defined in the INI file.
You can drag and drop a folder to the script to automatically "pass" it as the
argument.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Template</h3>
The first thing the script does is check for the <b>pyndexer.template.html</b> file
and if not found it will <a href="pyndexer.template.html">download</a> it to the same folder
where it is located. If you want, you can change it but keep in mind that it must be
somewhat simplistic as the parser will bail in any syntax error for a XML/1.0 Transitional file.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Online play of media files</h3>
By default it uses my own template, which means that it will set as playable all MP3 and MP4 files
it sees on the indexed folders. If you want to change it, change the template (and the
<i>INI:playinbrowser</i> option) to remove/alter this functionality.<br/>
The player was tested to work only on the same subdomain as the files, so if you aren't publishing
your files from <b>dl.dropbox.com</b> (it's configured in the template and in the jwplay.js file),
then you need to publish the dependencies yourself.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Encryption</h3>
The EXE version includes the AES support, but if you use the script version, you will need
<a href="http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto">M2Crypto</a> installed.
Use apt-get or something else to install it, like:<br/>
<pre>
apt-get install python-m2crypto <i>(ubuntu)</i>
easy_install m2crypto <i>(python's setuptools)</i>
</pre>
Then just set the <i>INI:password</i> option. Keep in mind that it is not magical, and will
<b>NOT</b> encrypt the files, just the links in the HTML index that point to them.<br/>
Thanks to Vincent Cheung's <a href="http://www.vincentcheung.ca/jsencryption/">jsencript</a>
the user's browser will decrypt it on-the-fly.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>WARNING: DEFAULTS TO WORK RECURSIVELY.</h3>
Meaning it <b>WILL overwrite ALL index.html</b> files in the configured folders and subfolders, <b>if you do not specify the <i>INI:skipdir=yes</i></b>.<br/>
<br/>
Side note: You can always use the revisions feature of dropbox to revert a lost index.html.<br/>
<br/>
